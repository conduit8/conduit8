**Our play:** Web form + GitHub flow

### 3. HTTP Access (Future)
**Their problem:** Local install only
**Our play:** API endpoints (broader use cases)

### 4. Quality Signals

**Our play:** Usage metrics, reviews, verified creators

## What NOT to Compete On (Yet)

### ❌ Monetization First
- Anthropic will likely launch official monetization
- You can't beat them on this
- Greedy positioning before value proven

### ❌ x402 Micropayments First
- Too complex for Day 1
- Unproven payment model
- Can add later once users exist

## Day 1 Positioning

**Value Prop:**
"Curated Claude Code skills directory with better discovery than GitHub chaos"

**Not:**
"Monetize your skills" (premature)
"Skills as APIs" (can't execute yet)

**Focus:**
Quality curation + easy publishing = better than current directories

## Skill Submissions

### Path 1: Web UI (Recommended)

**Best for:** Most users who want to submit a single skill quickly.

1. Visit https://conduit8.dev
2. Click the "Submit" button in the header
3. Upload your skill package as a ZIP file
4. Select the appropriate category
5. Submit and await review

**Requirements:**
- ZIP file containing `SKILL.md` (+ optional additional files)
- File size under 50MB
- Valid `SKILL.md` frontmatter (see format below)
- Unique skill name (validated automatically)

**Advantages:**
- Real-time validation (size, frontmatter, name uniqueness)
- Instant feedback on errors
- No git/GitHub knowledge required
- Fastest path to submission

### Path 2: GitHub PR (Alternative Method)

**Best for:** Contributors who prefer the git/GitHub workflow.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b skill/my-awesome-skill`
3. Create your skill directory: `skill-submissions/my-awesome-skill/`
4. Add your `SKILL.md` and any additional files
5. Commit using conventional commits: `feat: add my-awesome-skill`
6. Open a pull request using the skill submission template

**Directory Structure:**
```
skill-submissions/
â””â”€â”€ my-awesome-skill/
    â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md          # Required
    â”œâ”€â”€ example.py        # Optional supporting files
    â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Optional additional docs
```

**Why Choose GitHub PR?**
- Prefer git/GitHub workflow over web forms
- More familiar with pull request process
- Want version control of your submission
- Contribution visible in git history

**Note:** Both submission methods support the same skill capabilities and go through identical review processes. GitHub PR does not enable additional features - it's purely a workflow preference.

## SKILL.md Format

Every skill must include a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: My Awesome Skill
description: A brief description of what this skill does (max 500 chars)
license: MIT
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash
---

# My Awesome Skill

[Detailed instructions for Claude Code on how to use this skill...]

## Examples

[Usage examples...]

## Notes

[Additional context...]
```

**Required Fields:**
- `name`: Skill name (1-100 characters)
- `description`: Brief description (1-500 characters)

**Optional Fields:**
- `license`: License identifier (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, CC-BY-4.0)
- `allowed-tools`: Comma-separated list of tools the skill can use
- `metadata`: Custom key-value pairs for extensibility

**Content Below Frontmatter:**
- Write clear, detailed instructions for Claude Code
- Include examples demonstrating usage
- Explain any prerequisites or limitations
- Use markdown formatting for readability

## Review Process

**Timeline:** Submissions are typically reviewed within 3-5 business days.

**Process:**

1. **Automated Validation** (Web UI only)
   - File size check (< 50MB)
   - Frontmatter parsing and validation
   - Skill name uniqueness verification

2. **Manual Review**
   - Maintainer tests the skill locally
   - Verifies functionality and quality
   - Checks for policy compliance (no malicious code, appropriate content)

3. **Decision**
   - **Approved:** Skill is published to the registry and available via `npx conduit8 install skill <name>`
   - **Rejected:** Feedback provided with specific reasons and suggestions for improvement

**What We Look For:**
- Clear, well-written instructions
- Practical, useful functionality
- No security concerns (code review for suspicious patterns)
- Appropriate category classification
- Quality over quantity (one great skill > ten mediocre ones)

**After Approval:**
- Skill appears in search results: `npx conduit8 search skills`
- Available for installation globally
- Listed on conduit8.dev with download counts and ratings
